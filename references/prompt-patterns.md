# Prompt Patterns

## Foundation Board Prompt

Use for mood, palette, and material before logo work:

```text
Create a <brand> material and palette reference board, not a logo.
Arrange <materials/metaphors> in a clean <layout style>.
Palette: <named colors>. Lighting: <direction/quality>.
Design feeling: <era/product/culture>. No text, no logo, no watermark.
```

## Core Mark Prompt

```text
Design the primary <brand> logo mark using the referenced material board.
Create <one clear shape> with <one clear signal>.
The outer form should feel <emotional/material qualities>; the inner signal should feel <technical/precise qualities>.
Use <palette/material/lighting>. Centered, vector-friendly, readable at <small size>.
Avoid <specific old shape/readings>. No text except intentional symbol, no mascot, no watermark.
```

## Production Icon Prompt

```text
Convert the approved <brand> mark into a production app icon asset.
Preserve the exact mark relationship: <shape + signal>.
Target: <desktop/mobile/web>. Output intent: <transparent/opaque/adaptive>.
Use <material/lighting/depth>. Readable at 48 px.
Do not add <extra stones/background/tile/text/old brand>.
```

## Background Prompt

```text
Create a <brand> <hero/social/onboarding> background using the approved mark and material references.
Composition: <where product screenshot/text will sit>.
Mood: <culture/product tone>. Keep low visual noise behind UI.
No generated text, no extra logos, no watermark.
```

## Standing Negative Constraints (append to every generation prompt)

Ban the AI-slop signature explicitly; models default to it:

```text
No purple-blue gradients, no floating gradient orbs, no glassmorphism,
no sparkle/star AI icons, no fake 3D depth or bevels, no watermark,
no generated text.
```

## Prompt Hygiene

- Name colors and materials; do not rely on vague “modern” alone.
- State product context: developer tool, consumer app, operational SaaS, game, venue, etc.
- State what must stay fixed and what may vary.
- Use “not a logo” for foundation boards to prevent premature marks.
- Use “approved mark” for downstream outputs to prevent drift.
